## Deploying the Sample

1. Grab the [manifest file](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-Commands-Samples/blob/master/Word/manifest/CitationSample.xml) and sideload it per instructions on main [readme](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-Commands-Samples/blob/master/README.md). Note that the manifest points to an already deployed instance of the sample. If all you want to do is see the sample running, then that is it. 
2. If you also want to deploy the webapp on your own then you can grab the source from this its own [GitHub project](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-Fabric-UI-Sample). Make sure though to use the manifest on the previous step, otherwise you won't see commands on the Ribbon.
